# SimpleMapper.Abstractions

This project contains the core abstractions for the SimpleMapper library, including the base interfaces required to define and consume type mappers.

## Purpose

This project is dependency-free and can be referenced independently in other libraries, promoting loose coupling and enabling testing and mock implementations without bringing in the entire mapping system.
